Power point remote control for your phone

The history of this "project" is:
I needed a remote control for a presentation. So this is really crappy and unuseable, it's more because I'm too lazy to search for this every time I need it so I put it on my github.

It works 2 go on os x high sierra, and if you want to use it on os x 10.7 change from the php development server to the apache one in the .command file.
The client doesn't reconnect if it looses control to the websocket server.

Oh and the build is really simple: websocket server that simulates next and prev keys with cliclick and a simple client

## Use on your own risk, the code is obvious
